Title = Pointers Basics


Aim: To study and implement C++Pointer basics


Tool: VS Code and C++ compiler


Theory: 
•	Pointers are symbolic representations of addresses. 
•	They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures. 
•	Iterating over elements in arrays or other data structures is one of the main use of pointers. 
•	The address of the variable you’re working with is assigned to the pointer variable that points to the same data type (such as an int or string).


Conclusion: Pointers are special variables that store the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a value (like 10 or 'c'), they hold the location where a value is stored. This allows for direct memory manipulation, which is a powerful and essential feature for several tasks.
